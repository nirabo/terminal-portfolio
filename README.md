# Terminal Portfolio Website

A terminal-style portfolio website built with React, TypeScript and Styled-Components. Features multiple themes and keyboard shortcuts for enhanced functionality.

## Personalization

The portfolio is fully configurable through a JSON configuration file. You can customize both personal information and system settings:

### Configuration Options

```json
{
  "personal": {
    "name": "Your name",
    "jobTitle": "Your role",
    "location": "Your location",
    "description": "Brief bio",
    "email": "your.email@example.com",
    "education": [...],
    "projects": [...],
    "socials": [...]
  },
  "system": {
    "homedir": "/home/username",
    "gui": {
      "url": "https://your-portfolio-website.com"
    },
    "terminal": {
      "user": "guest",
      "host": "portfolio"
    }
  }
}
```

### Setting Up Your Configuration

1. Option 1 - Using a GitHub Gist (Recommended):
   - Go to https://gist.github.com
   - Create a new public Gist named `config.json`
   - Copy the contents from `config.template.json` and update with your information
   - Save the Gist and copy the raw URL (click the "Raw" button)
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```bash
     echo "VITE_CONFIG_GIST_URL=<your-gist-raw-url>" > .env
     ```
   
   Note: Make sure to use the "Raw" URL from your Gist (click the "Raw" button and copy the URL).
   The app will automatically handle fetching the configuration using a CORS proxy.

2. Option 2 - Using Local Config:
   - Copy `config.template.json` to create your own configuration:
     ```bash
     cp config.template.json config.json
     ```
   - Update the values in `config.json` with your information

### System Customization

The `system` section in the config allows you to customize:
- Terminal appearance (`user@host` display)
- Home directory path (shown in pwd command)
- GUI website URL (opened by 'gui' command)

## Multiple Themes

Currently, this website supports 6 themes. Type `themes` in the terminal for more info.

## Running Locally

Fork or clone this repository to create your own terminal portfolio:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terminal-portfolio.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd terminal-portfolio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The portfolio will first try to load configuration from the Gist URL if provided,
otherwise it will fall back to using the local configuration.
